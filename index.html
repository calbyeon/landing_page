        <div class = "quote-text">NE Portland is rich with history. Tragically this history includes gentrification and discrimination of people of color by the white majority. The NEPTL seeks to improve its diversity not only of race but also of perspectives and identities which will enrich our mission and equip us to be more accountable to the structures of white supremacy. We stand with the Black Lives Matter movement and the demand for racial justice in this country and this city.</div>
